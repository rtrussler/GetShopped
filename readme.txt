ADD THE CODE HIGHLIGHTED BETWEEN THE TAGS IN THE MAIN FILE TO YOUR WPSC PRODUCT PAGE

THIS SHOULD BE LOCATED IN YOUR THEME DIRECTORY NAMED wspc_product-page.php

REMEMBER TO INCLUDE THE FINAL CLOSING ‘}’ OF THE IF ELSE STATEMENT FROM THE ADDED CODE

SEE FULL FILE IN GH FOR POSITIONING

SOME BASIC INLINE CSS HAS BEEN INCLUDED AND ALSO DISPLAYS THE CATEGORY IMAGE

HAVE TESTED THIS TO 10 LEVELS - WAY BEYOND WHAT SHOULD BE NEED

******************************************************************************************

NOTE: HAVE NOTICED A SMALL ISSUE - DOESNT AFFECT THE WAY THIS WORKS BUT IS WORTHING NOTING

 -- IF YOU HAVE PRODUCT CATEGORY NAMES WITH ONLY NUMERIC NAMES SUCG AS 753 OR 7654 THIS
 	DOESNT SEEM TO WORK CORRECTLY.
 	IT WORKS PERFECTLY FINE IF THE CATEGORY NAME WITH ALPHA NUMNERIC - JUST ADD N ALPHA 
 	CHARACTER.
